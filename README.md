# SimpleTS

SimpleTS was created as a simplified Tuple Space system after reviewing PyBrenda and PyLinda for use in the parallel programming course in Troms√∏. Since the students only used tuple spaces in one of the projects, I wanted something that had a smaller code base and was simpler to set up and use, so I wrote this version. It doesn't have the full Linda semantics for tuple matching, borrowing simplifications from PyBrenda.

SimpleTS uses [Pyro](https://github.com/irmen/Pyro4) (Python Remote Objects).

The current version uses Pyro 3.5 and Python 2. An archived copy of Pyro 3.5 is available [here](http://www.cs.uit.no/~johnm/code/teaching/Pyro-3.5.tar.gz).
